TODO 
[] Choose ASCII art
[x] Choose Code Structure


Primary Requirements
[x] one letter at a time
  [x] use puts statement to elict the letter guess
  [x] ERROR Handle that guess check that the've only done that
  [x] print out dummy array of underscores
  [x] undeerscore array length should equal word length array
  [x] is user guess matches ANY letter in the word array

[] display
  [] use loop to redraw ASCII art after each correct or incorrect guess
  [] consider if/ else or case statement to handle how ASCII is displayed
  [x] ALWAYS display previous correct guess handled by above output array
  [x] WIN = output array == word_array && WIN = guess_number < length + 5
  [x] Lose = output array != word_array || Lose > guess_number
    [x] consider using loop < word_array.length + 2
    [] will need iterator for guess_number


We WANT to 
[x] split the word into an array from FAKER
      (x) a test word
      (x) an intergration of FAKER
[-] we the user to choose the category of words.
